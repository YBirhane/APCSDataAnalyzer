# APCSDatatAnalyzer

----------------------
Overview
---------------------

This is a Python script that runs analysis on the College Board's AP CS Data (P, AB, A) and extracts demographic statistics on race and gender. To run, copy the appropriate file to a folder containing all datasets and run the program. A separate csv file with the aggregated data and summary statistics will be produced.
